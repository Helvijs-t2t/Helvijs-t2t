 About me


## Hi, I’m Helvijs 👋

Senior Digitalization Specialist focused on turning real-world operations into data‑driven, user‑friendly systems. I work across the Microsoft ecosystem (Power Platform, Dynamics 365, Azure) to automate processes, surface actionable insights, and build tools people actually enjoy using.

### What I do
- **Process & Workflow Automation:** Power Automate + Dataverse + SharePoint to remove manual steps and increase reliability.
- **Apps that fit the job:** Power Apps (model & canvas) for warehouse and production scenarios, with clean UX and role‑based access.
- **Data & Reporting:** Power BI dashboards that prioritize clarity, context, and decisions—backed by solid modeling and governance.
- **ERP & Integrations:** D365 (FO/SCM) process design, vendor integration reviews, mapping FDDs, and end‑to‑end testing.
- **IoT & Monitoring:** Equipment telemetry, condition monitoring, and cloud dashboards to support service and production teams.
- **Human‑centred delivery:** Requirements gathering, stakeholder alignment, change management, and training built into every project.

### How I work
- **Start with the problem, not the tool.** Clarify constraints, measures of success, and the user journey.
- **Build iteratively.** Prototype → validate with end users → harden architecture and security → scale.
- **Make it maintainable.** Naming standards, environments/solutions, ALM, and documentation for hand‑offs.
- **Measure outcomes.** Adoption metrics, cycle-time reductions, error-rate drops, and stakeholder feedback.

### Tools & technologies
- **Core:** Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, Dataverse, SharePoint, Azure
- **ERP:** Dynamics 365 (FO/SCM), Lasernet/document services, integrations (REST/JSON)
- **Data/Dev:** SQL, data modeling, testing, DevOps/ALM
- **Ops:** Requirements, FDD reviews, stakeholder management, training & enablement

### Interests
- Practical AI in operations (translation, assistance, anomaly detection)
- Sustainable digitalization and low‑friction user experiences
- Standards, governance, and the craft of clear documentation

### Values
- **Clarity over complexity.** Prefer simple solutions that scale.
- **Empathy for users.** Tools should reduce cognitive load, not add it.
- **Ownership & collaboration.** Share context, unblock quickly, deliver reliably.
